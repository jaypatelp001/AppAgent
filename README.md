# AppAgent
AppAgent automates interactions with Android apps using computer vision, UI element analysis, and NLP. It captures screenshots, detects UI components, and interprets user commands to perform tasks like navigation, input, and scrolling. Future plans include extending support to iOS and enhancing vision and NLP capabilities.
